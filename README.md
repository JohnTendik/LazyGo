# LazyGo
This APP will spoof and move your GPS coordinates by a little bit, giving the impression of walking. 


# I DO NOT CONDONE THIS
## THEREFORE THE SOURCE CODE IS NOT HERE &/OR PRIVATE!

I created this APP for myself to use because I am LAZY and I do not wish to walk around at night just to catch Pokemon. With the new release of Pokemon GO I needed a way to travel around my area, without actually travelling around my area... YES This is cheating, I do not condone it. But I do like to think its best to work SMART and not HARD. I have nothing against the developers of this game, in fact I wish to support them as much as I can. This is a personal project which can do a lot of damage so I will not release the source code.
